What You're Aiming For
Your task is to create a basic webpage for a fictional restaurant menu. Use HTML to structure the content and include some common elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.

Here are the specifications for your restaurant menu webpage:

Create a webpage with a title that reflects the name of the restaurant (e.g., "Delicious Bites Menu").
Include a heading for each section of the menu: Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts.
Under each heading, list at least three items with their names and brief descriptions.
Use an unordered list for each section of the menu.
Add a link at the bottom of the page leading to a contact page (you don't need to create the contact page, just include a placeholder link).
 

 


Instructions
Feel free to use placeholder names and descriptions for the menu items. 

Here's a simple example to get you started:

<!DOCTYPE html>

 <html lang="en"> 

<head>    

<meta charset="UTF-8">  

  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">   

 <title>Delicious Bites Menu</title> </head>

 <body>   

 <h1>Delicious Bites Menu</h1>

    <h2>Appetizers</h2>  

  <ul>     

   <li>          

  <strong>Caprese Salad</strong>       

     <p>Fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil drizzled with balsamic glaze.</p> 

       </li>    

    <!-- Add two more appetizer items with descriptions --> 

   </ul>  

  <h2>Main Courses</h2> 

   <ul>   

     <li>      

      <strong>Grilled Salmon</strong>     

       <p>Salmon fillet seasoned and grilled to perfection, served with lemon butter sauce.</p>   

     </li>     

   <!-- Add two more main course items with descriptions --> 

   </ul>   

 <h2>Desserts</h2>  

  <ul>     

   <li>    

        <strong>Chocolate Fondue</strong>     

       <p>Assorted fruits and marshmallows served with rich chocolate fondue.</p>    

    </li>    

    <!-- Add two more dessert items with descriptions -->  

  </ul> 

   <p><a href="contact.html">Contact us for reservations</a></p> 

</body>

 </html>

Your task is to complete the HTML code by adding two more items under each section and providing names and descriptions for those items. Feel free to be creative with your menu items!
